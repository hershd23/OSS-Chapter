# OSS-Chapter

## Introduction
Welcome to the Open Source Software (OSS) Chapter of Softcom, IIT Ropar! The goal of the OSS Chapter is to encourage Open Source contribution from IIT Ropar students to in-campus maintained projects as well as projects of various external organizations. This will also provide a platform for actualization of Open Source project initiatives of students, by allowing the project to be added to a list of projects open for contribution.
